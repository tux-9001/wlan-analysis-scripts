# üì° Wi-Fi Network Analysis Toolkit

A collection of Python scripts for analyzing `.pcap` files from wireless network captures. These tools help extract SSID information, classify access point types, associate client devices, visualize IoT activity, and evaluate encryption and channel usage.

---

## üß© Scripts & Usage

### `readNetworks.py`

**Description**  
Analyzes `.pcap` files by checking for probe responses and beacon frames from access points, then associates the hardware addresses of those access points with the SSID they broadcast. Tracks valid data frames between client devices and those access points to associate devices with specific SSIDs.

**Output**  
A binary data file used by other scripts.

**Usage**  
`readNetworks.py <capture.pcap>`

---

### `analyzeNetworks.py`

**Description**  
Converts binary files generated by `readNetworks.py` into human-readable summaries.

**Usage**  
`analyzeNetworks.py <binary_data_file> <options>`

**Available Options**  
- `-noIoT` ‚Äì Excludes IoT SSIDs  
- `-noPrinters` ‚Äì Excludes printer SSIDs  
- `-noDirect` ‚Äì Excludes Wi-Fi Direct SSIDs  
- `-noStandard` ‚Äì Excludes standard infrastructure networks

### `PHYcap2024.py`

**Description**  
Reports the distribution of different generations of 802.11 networks (e.g., 802.11n, ac, ax).

**Usage**  
`PHYcap2024.py`  
*You will be prompted to enter a `.pcap` file.*

---

### `ChannelAvg.py`

**Description**  
Identifies the top 3 most-used Wi-Fi channels in a packet capture.

**Usage**  
`ChannelAvg.py <input.pcap>`

---

### `networksWithDevices.py`

**Description**  
Generates bar charts showing networks with specific categories of IoT devices connected. Each binary file is shown as a separate chart.

**Usage**  
`networksWithDevices.py <binary_data_files> -labels <label1> <label2> ...`

- `-labels` is optional and assigns labels to each chart.

---

### `graphAPtypes.py`

**Description**  
Creates a pie chart showing proportions of nonstandard AP types (Direct, Printer, IoT).

**Usage**  
`graphAPtypes.py <binary_data_file>`

---

### `graphIoTAPs.py`

**Description**  
Generates a pie chart that breaks down IoT APs into types (camera, setup mode, appliances).

**Usage**  
`graphIoTAPs.py <binary_data_file>`

---

### `categorizeDevices.py`

**Description**  
Creates bar charts of total IoT device counts by category for each binary data file.

**Usage**  
`categorizeDevices.py <binary_data_files> -labels <label1> <label2> ...`

- `-labels` is optional and used to label each chart.

---

### `encryptionCount.py`

**Description**  
Displays the top 3 encryption methods used in the specified `.pcap` file.

**Usage**  
`encryptionCount.py`  
*You will be prompted to enter a `.pcap` file.*

---

### `combineDataFiles.py`

**Description**  
Merges two binary data files produced by `readNetworks.py`. Can remove duplicate entries.

**Usage**  
`combineDataFiles.py <data_file_1> <data_file_2> -chkDupes`

- `-chkDupes` is optional and filters out duplicate networks/devices.

---

### `rangeIoTdevices.py`

**Description**  
Displays a bar chart categorizing networks based on the number of IoT devices connected.

**Usage**  
`rangeIoTdevices.py <binary_data_files> -labels <label1> <label2> ...`

- `-labels` is optional and adds labels for each binary file.

---

## üß∞ Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- [Scapy](https://scapy.net/)  
- `matplotlib`  
- Packet captures collected in monitor mode (e.g., using `tcpdump` or `airodump-ng`)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Legal Notice

Only analyze network traffic from systems you own or have explicit permission to monitor. Unauthorized packet analysis may violate privacy laws or terms of service.
